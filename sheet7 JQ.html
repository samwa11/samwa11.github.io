    <h1>What Does Query Mean?</h1>
    <p> A query is a request for data or information from a database table or combination of tables. This data may be generated as results returned by Structured Query Language (SQL) or as pictorials, graphs or complex results, e.g., trend analyses from data-mining tools.<br><br>
 
      One of several different query languages may be used to perform a range of simple to complex database queries. SQL, the most well-known and widely-used query language, is familiar to most database administrators (DBAs).<br><br>
 
      For a machine to understand a request for information in the first place, the query must be written according to a code known as query language. For example, if you go to a bank and ask “Can I have an espresso?” the teller might be puzzled.<br><br>
 
      SQL represents one of the standard languages used for database management purposes, while MySQL, instead, is the software using that specific language. Although SQL is a fairly universal query language, other commonly used ones include DMX, Datalog and AQL.<br><br>
